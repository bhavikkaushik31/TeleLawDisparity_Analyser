# Tele-Law Disparity Analyzer

## üìå Project Overview
The **TeleLaw Disparity Analyzer** is a data-driven project aimed at uncovering and addressing demographic and regional disparities in legal aid access through the **Tele-Law initiative**. Despite the expansion of the initiative across Indian states and districts, there remains a limited understanding of utilization patterns across gender, caste, and geography.  
This project leverages **IBM Cloud Lite** services and machine learning to analyze official Tele-Law case registration datasets, normalize for CSC (Common Service Center) availability, and predict underserved regions and communities.

## üéØ Problem Statement
Despite the expansion of the Tele-Law initiative across states and districts, there is limited understanding of demographic utilization patterns and regional disparities in legal aid access.  
The challenge is to:
- Analyze Tele-Law case registration data to uncover **gender-wise, caste-wise, and geographic disparities**.
- Identify uneven representation among marginalized groups (**SC, ST, OBC**) and low outreach areas.
- Normalize for the varying number of CSCs per region to ensure fair comparisons.
- Deliver a **data-driven approach** to evaluate inclusivity and optimize service delivery.

## üí° Proposed Solution
The **TeleLaw Disparity Analyzer**:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, standardize, and normalize demographic and geographic data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Compute utilization ratios, disparity indicators, and per-CSC metrics.
- **Analysis & Prediction:** Use **IBM WatsonX AI** to train models for disparity detection and forecasting.
- **Visualization:** Create interactive charts, maps, and reports for clear interpretation.
- **Deployment:** Provide APIs for integration into dashboards and policy decision tools.

**Key Benefits:**
- Enables targeted outreach to marginalized communities.
- Provides data-backed insights for equitable resource allocation.
- Supports policy transparency and accountability.
